Agent: SAC Agent

Model: m_0 (3520 checkpoint which isn't the highest we have)

Hyperparameters: {
    'actor_architecture': (64, 64), 
    'actor_activation_function': <class 'torch.nn.modules.activation.ReLU'>, 
    'critic_architecture': (64, 64), 
    'critic_activation_function': <class 'torch.nn.modules.activation.ReLU'>
    }

Also testing smaller gap between updates for sample efficiency
